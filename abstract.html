Jiro<SUP><FONT SIZE="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> technology is designed to solve major development problems, given that no single solution can encompass all of the devices in a heterogeneous, distributed corporate network. It provides a standard, industry-defined middle tier of components and services that facilitate connectivity between
managed resources and management applications. These resources can be located anywhere on the corporate network, connected with a combination of routers
and hubs, using any standard management protocol.

<P>
Jiro technology has sparked significant interest among vendors of devices
and developers of management software. This session examines the challenges
presented when developing Jiro technology-based management applications and common
steps needed to take advantage of APIs for Jiro technology.
</P>
<P>
This session presents a high-level overview of Jiro technology and existing approaches to Jiro technology-based management applications:
<UL>
<LI>Why use Jiro technology?</LI>
<LI>What tasks can be solved with the help of Jiro technology?</LI>
<LI>How do I create a Jiro technology-based "application" ("Jiro application")?</LI>
<LI>What problems have to be solved to build a functional Jiro application?</LI>
<LI>Are there ways to simplify Jiro applications development?</LI>
<LI>Can I take advantage of reusable components to speed up the development
process?</LI>
<LI>Are there any reference applications built based on a similar approach?</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
This session tries to answer these and other questions related to the design of
Jiro applications.
</P>
<P>
You hear about the design ideas behind the building blocks for Jiro
applications and what common tasks have to be solved to create a
functional application. You find out what has already been done in
this direction. You are given an example of a Jiro application using
an approach capable of managing Jiro technology-based services and interacting with them. This application submitted to Jiro Technology Build a Bean won first
place in one of the categories.
